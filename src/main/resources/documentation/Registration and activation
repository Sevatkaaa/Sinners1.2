To register user, send POST request to {base.url}/register with params:

    name (String)
    password (String)
    checkPassword (String)
    email (String)
    
    1) if password != checkPassword, response will be errorCode 30
    2) if email is invalid, response will be errorCode 21
    3) if user with current name already exists, response will be errorCode 41
    4) if message can't be sent, response will be errorCode 20
    
    Otherwise, you will register a new user and email will be sent to email address
    
    Activation link in email will be {base.url}/activation/{activationCode}
    
    Don't forget to add your ip to application.properties as {base.url} value
    Also don't forget to set right value for password {spring.mail.password} value
    
To activate this user, follow the link in message or send GET to {base.url}/activation/{activationCode}

    Until user's activation code in db is NOT null, he is NOT active
    When you follow the link, activation code in db will become null and user will be active from this moment
